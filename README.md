     b. Validated - Providing a valid id
     
     c. Validated - Providing an invalid id
     
     d. Validated - Providing a non-existent id

3. For Name :
     a. Validated - Without providing a name
   
     b. Validated - Providing a valid name
   
** Invalid name has been validated but that is just returning 404 so not added as the separate test case.

  1. Status Code
  2. Key properties and it's value
  3. Properties of Json Array -> it's Index + Value
